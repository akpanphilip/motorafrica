                            In today's economic climate, many car dealerships in Africa are facing challenges due to
                            inflation, which is limiting consumers' purchasing power. This situation has made it
                            increasingly difficult for dealerships to close sales quickly. However, offering hire purchase
                            options can be a game-changer, accelerating car sales and providing customers with a feasible
                            path to ownership.

                                Hire purchase allows buyers to acquire vehicles while paying in installments, making it
                                easier for them to manage their finances amid rising costs. This model can significantly
                                speed up sales, as it attracts a broader range of customers who may not have the full
                                purchase amount available upfront.
