                            Why Sell Your Old Vehicle? Offer It on Hire Purchase Instead
                        </p>

                            Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there lived a man named David. He was a devoted husband
                            who wanted to surprise his wife, Sarah, with a brand-new car as a push gift after the birth of
                            their first child. After much consideration, he chose a sleek SUV that would perfectly suit
                            their growing family.
                        </p>
                        <p class="blog-page-subtitle caption-sub-title mb-0">
                            Excited about the new addition, David contemplated selling Sarah's old car. However, as he
                            looked into the market, he realized that selling it outright wouldn't yield much profit. Thatâ€™s
                            when a brilliant idea struck him: why not offer it on hire purchase?
                        </p>
                        <p class="blog-page-subtitle caption-sub-title mb-0">
                            David decided to set up a 6-month repayment plan for the old car. He found a potential buyer,
                            John, who was eager to own the same model but lacked the full cash amount. With this
                            arrangement, David could earn extra income through the interest on the payments.
