                        Using a single API, lending companies can originate new loan applications directly from their
                        mobile app or website. If a dedicated website is not available, lenders can open an account on
                        the dedicated lending service dashboard provided by Motor Africa.

                        The Motor Africa system conducts pre-approval underwriting and automatically shares the results
                        with lenders on their dashboard for final approval. The displayed results include various data
                        points that assist lenders in making informed lending decisions.

                        The Motor Africa system manages disbursals and loan collections, with automated asset control
                        for collateral in case of default.
                        In the event of default, the vehicle engines of defaulters are immobilized and reactivated
                        automatically when payments are confirmed.
