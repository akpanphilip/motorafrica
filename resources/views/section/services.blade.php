                        To simplify business operations, businesses can leverage an adaptable embedded finance API. This
                        API allows businesses to integrate various financial functionalities seamlessly into their
                        systems. By utilizing this API, businesses can automate processes such as remittance collection,
                        tax charging, penalty enforcement, and driver rewards. This streamlined approach reduces manual
                        effort, enhances efficiency, and enables businesses to focus on core operations.
