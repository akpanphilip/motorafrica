                            In today's economic climate, many car dealerships in Africa are facing challenges due to
                            inflation, which is limiting consumers' purchasing power. This situation has made it
                            increasingly difficult for dealerships to close sales quickly. However, offering hire purchase
                            options can be a game-changer, accelerating car sales and providing customers with a feasible
                            path to ownership.
